# node-weather-website
A website that fetches weather for a location entered by the user.

Website <a href="https://patterson-weather-application.herokuapp.com/">here.</a>

Utilizes JavaScript, NodeJS, Handlebars, HTML, and CSS.

# Instructions
In order to get weather for the current location, simply enter in
your address, zip code, or city. The app will provide you with the
current weather conditions as well as the temperature.

# Features
This was a simple project app built while learning NodeJS, 
asynch JS, and utilizing handlebars. I would still like to add in some
fun features to this site just to keep practicing my skills. Planned features include:

- Night mode (I hate bright white screens on web pages)
- Simple graphics to display the current weather conditions
- Location based weather that will request the users location so they don't have to type it in
- Improved UI to make the web page look more modern
